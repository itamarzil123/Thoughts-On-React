React-15: (vs previous versions v0.14, v0.3)
--------------------------------
from the official changeLog:
         document.createElement is in and data-reactid is out
         No more extra <span>s
         React.cloneElement() now resolves defaultProps
         Function components can now return null too

         Deprecated APIs are removed from the React top-level export:
         findDOMNode, render, renderToString, renderToStaticMarkup, and unmountComponentAtNode.
         As a reminder, they are now available on ReactDOM and ReactDOMServer.
         Deprecated addons are removed: batchedUpdates and cloneWithProps.
         Deprecated component instance methods are removed: setProps, replaceProps, and getDOMNode.
         React-specific properties on DOM refs (e.g. this.refs.div.props) were deprecated,
         and are removed now
my observations:

1. $$typeof: Symbol(react.element) is now holding the id of a React component

2. data-reactroot is used (as opposed to ReactRootId[] in v0.3, v0.14)

0. this.updater inside ReactClass is the same as in v0.14. this.updater is the object inside ReactClass
   which stores methods like enqueueSetState and replaceState

1. module system resolver: recognize the module system used by the React user.
   commonJS? AMD? otherwise just put React on the global object
2. sub modules resolver function that manages the entire inner 'require' of internals modules inside
   the React library. it is very ugly and bad designed.. it is a good decision by the React team to abandon
   this attitude.
3. until line 700, I see no interesting/important code to research, but only React internal Event system
   meaningless names

4. in line 900, CallbackQueue is defined (with Pooledclass) just like ReactOnDOMReady in version 0.3, 0.14
   this module is responsible for handling callbacks like componentDidMount/DidUpdate to run after component's
   markup has been injected to the DOM. the queue itself is a list of React components ready to be notified
   after their DOM has been injected. callbackQueue holds _callbacks and _contexts. and for example
   notifyAll will call each callback with the matching context. (callback.call(context))
5. reading through lines 1200+ it seems like React overall suffers from tightling coupling of different units
   such as the React Event system and the DOM utils and the React API (or namings), etc  . . .
   the way React is written is not modular. the way the reader reads the code is very not clear,
   too much complexity, and too much chaos. not clear which are the basic units and which are the bigger/higher
   units of engineering.
6. module 28: React policies still exist apparently (as in v0.3 and v.14) except for additions:
   DEFINE_MANY_MERGED,
   ReactClassInterface I believe is the new ReactCompositeComponentInterface
   bindAutoBindMethod also still exists.

7. ReactClass is a the module to create composite components in v15

NOTES: even in versions 0.14, 0.3, and in 15, still it all feels like a magic.
How exactly React works internally ?









NOTES:
    The DOM CompositionEvent represents events that occur due to the user indirectly entering text.
