in These 'thoughts-on-React' bunch of documents I share my journey of trying to understand what's
going on inside React. I hope you will find anything useful.
In addition to reading the 'thoughts-on' documents, 
uou can also run the simple examples (which are fully detailed console logs)
Please be patient (those thoughts were written for me only and then only editted for public use)

I'm waiting for your thoughts on React internals, send me ideas or thoughts you had,
help me improve my understanding, etc ..

You can reach me at:

                                      Good Luck !
