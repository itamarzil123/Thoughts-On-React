------------------------------------------------------------
The module resolving that is used in React v0.14, v0.3, v15:
------------------------------------------------------------

a very mechanical, hard to follow and reason about, ES3 styled module resolution system
besides the IFEE, the factory function that it accepts, and the entire structure that 
describes an array of tuples: each tuple is a React module, and its dependencies which are 
the indexes of other React modules that it depends upon. since I believe it is un friendly
piece of code and would not like to fully dive in it in this introduction document,
I will skip it (you can follow the console logs when running react in this project and get a better understanding)
The important take from this primitive module resolving system is that it sucessfully delivers a working module system,
(though IIFE based modules can be built in better ways).
In practice, the first module that is being used and starts the entire React engine is: 90.
