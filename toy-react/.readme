How to run a Reoco app ?
---------------------------

npm run app

Enjoy !


TODOS:
- fix script that opens dev server at 8080 and not 1234 with the old app
- in the middle of extracting a real DOM tree from the jsx with the 'transform' function,
  we need also to generate a component instance tree.
- each component should have a link to its parent: component._nativeParentNode
  so that whenever reconciliation happens we need to update and then component._nativeParentNode.appendChild(newRenderedChild)
- add reconciliation diffing
- add more event listeners, validation, etc ...
